TABARI-Dictionaries
===================

These are an assortment of the more commonly used dictionary files (and the ``.options`` file used to generate the Levant data set) used with the TABARI event coding program. The program is available at either 

http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/software.dir/tabari.html

or 

https://github.com/philip-schrodt/TABARI-Code

The TABARI program has generally been superseded by the PETRARCH coder and we are no longer actively working on either the program or the dictionaries: details on that transition are described here:

http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/tabari.dir/petrarch.html

A more extensive set of dictionaries can be found incorporated into the zipped files of the various data sets at 

http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/data.html

However, these have not been updated since about 2012, and several of them date back to the early 2000s. The CountryInfo data set may also be of interest

The newer PETRARCH dictionaries can be found at

These are not directly compatible with TABARI but if you are the sort of person who is browsing GitHub, it would be relatively straightforward to convert them.
